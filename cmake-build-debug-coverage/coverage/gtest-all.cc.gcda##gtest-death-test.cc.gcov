        -:  625:// WindowsDeathTest implements death tests on Windows. Due to the
        -:  626:// specifics of starting new processes on Windows, death tests there are
        -:  627:// always threadsafe, and Google Test considers the
        -:  628:// --gtest_death_test_style=fast setting to be equivalent to
        -:  629:// --gtest_death_test_style=threadsafe there.
        -:  630://
        -:  631:// A few implementation notes:  Like the Linux version, the Windows
        -:  632:// implementation uses pipes for child-to-parent communication. But due to
        -:  633:// the specifics of pipes on Windows, some extra steps are required:
        -:  634://
        -:  635:// 1. The parent creates a communication pipe and stores handles to both
        -:  636://    ends of it.
        -:  637:// 2. The parent starts the child and provides it with the information
        -:  638://    necessary to acquire the handle to the write end of the pipe.
        -:  639:// 3. The child acquires the write end of the pipe and signals the parent
        -:  640://    using a Windows event.
        -:  641:// 4. Now the parent can release the write end of the pipe on its side. If
        -:  642://    this is done before step 3, the object's reference count goes down to
        -:  643://    0 and it is destroyed, preventing the child from acquiring it. The
        -:  644://    parent now has to release it, or read operations on the read end of
        -:  645://    the pipe will not return when the child terminates.
        -:  646:// 5. The parent reads child's output through the pipe (outcome code and
        -:  647://    any possible error messages) from the pipe, and its stderr and then
        -:  648://    determines whether to fail the test.
